			<h2>What Would the World Do Without Tea? </h2>
		<p>From the farthest reaches of the globe, Teacloud brings to the discerning tea connoisseur the widest array of fine teas available. For those with a discriminating palate, we ensure that each tea is hand picked, hand processed, and freshly delivered.</p>
		<p>Teacloud was founded by William and Hilary Rourke in Venice, California after the couple realized that there was a staggering paucity of fine tea retailers and importers in teh area. What began as a small neighborhood tea shop quickly became one of the largest specialty tea imports in Southern California, if not the entire United States. It is by means of this growth that Teacloud has been able to extend a level of truly international service that few can match. </p></td>
